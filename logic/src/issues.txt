    make a repetition table with zobrist hashing  
    https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Threefold_repetition


whenever you write a function
if it has parameters:
    if you do not change the parameter:
        write it as:
            const type &x
    if you do change it:
        write it as:
            type &x
this is to stop c++ from creating a copy of the variable every single time our function runs
ex.
void function(const int &unchanged_variable, int &changing_variable)


IDEA:
what if we had two piece square tables for each piece
and use tapered eval to interpolate between them
we can also use that for the nnue so that it is not stuck only looking at one game phase at a tim
