    on this fen: rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/8/2N5/PPPPPPPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2, when you search (iterative deepening/negamax) to depth >=3, both normal search and quiscence search are part of the issue
    add insufficient material draw
    remove debugging comments ex. std::cout << "here" << std::endl;
    work on updating zobrist hashing in play_move and undo_move functions

    make a repetition table with zobrist hashing

whenever you write a function
if it has parameters:
    if you do not change the parameter:
        write it as:
            const type &x
    if you do change it:
        write it as:
            type &x
this is to stop c++ from creating a copy of the variable every single time our function runs
ex.
void function(const (type size >= 8 bytes) &unchanged_variable, (type size >= 8 bytes) &changing_variable, const (type size < 8) small_unchanged_variable, (type size < 8) small_normal_variable)
note: if a type size is smaller than 8 bytes, it is better to not use & because a pointer is 8 bytes long

IDEA:
what if we had two piece square tables for each piece
and use tapered eval to interpolate between them
we can also use that for the nnue so that it is not stuck only looking at one game phase at a time
