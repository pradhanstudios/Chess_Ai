TODO:
    when you run perft 3 or higher, it turns all of the black pieces to white pieces
    also something is very wrong with play move and undo move


    make a repetition table with zobrist hashing

whenever you write a function
if it has parameters:
    if you do not change the parameter:
        write it as:
            const type &x
    if you do change it:
        write it as:
            type &x
this is to stop c++ from creating a copy of the variable every single time our function runs
ex.
void function(const int &unchanged_variable, int &changing_variable)
